# Personal Portfolio (v3) for Alex King | Software Engineer

#### Introduction

My portfolio began on a quiet Sunday morning at my local coffee shop. The aim was to make a stylistically unique and calm website to communicate my interests, values, as well as technical skills and offerings to new and existing clients.

#### Overview

By approaching this project from scratch with little outside design reference (I started with paper and pen), I was able to create a unique portfolio layout and design that aligns with my style, skills, and values. The color choice for this site (inspired by my local coffee shop) helps reinforce one of my core goals with this project - to communicate a calm and authentic energy.
