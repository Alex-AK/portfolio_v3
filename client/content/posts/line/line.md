## Introduction

LINE is an online home goods store for handmade accessories, furniture, lighting, linens, and prints built to match the optimism and curiousity of the business owner herself.

## Overview

As a growing business, LINE needed an online market place to sell their unique handmade debut collection. The client required a fast turn around time and needed a stylish and reliable website they could easily manage with limited web knowledge.
With a clear design goal in mind, I produced wire frames, user interface / user experiences mockups, and implemented a database model to support their inventory needs. After several revisions and refinements, the website was built quickly and tested extensively before release.

## Features

- Simple and elegant design to match business aesthetic.
- Online sales platform with sales analytics.
- Fully responsive to all device sizes.
- Strong foundation for expansion.
