## Introduction

## Summary

From a quiet Sunday morning coffee shop brainstorming session, portfolio was born. With scribbled design sketches and my ideal user experience in mind, I got to work. Once the basic structure of the site was in place I spent hours refining the styles and user experience to deliver the product you see today.

Starting a new project can be daunting, but with dedicated planning and detailed notes, I was able to deliver the site you see from start to finish in four weeks of development.
