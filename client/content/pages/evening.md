# An Evening üçΩ

An Evening is a collection of virtual and Seattle based events to help connect friends, neighbors, and acquaintances.

The idea came when a friend shared a story of homemade calzone night - where friends, neighbors, and acquaintances would come together monthly to share an evening together.
