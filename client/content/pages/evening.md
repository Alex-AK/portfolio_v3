# An Evening üçΩ

An Evening is a collection of virtual and Seattle based events to help connect friends, neighbors, and acquaintances.

The idea came when a friend shared a story of homemade calzone night - where friends, neighbors, and acquaintances would come together monthly to share an evening together.

In response to health precautions, in person events are currently postponed until it is safe to gather.
