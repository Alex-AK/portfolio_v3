# **Hello**, Daniel and Chris of Topia!

My name is <a href="/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex King</a>.

We met at the Product Hunt camp fire a few days ago. Immediately upon joining Topia and strolling up to the camp fire, I had an overwhelmingly positive experience, sense of synchronicity, and belonging.

Topia's mission of bringing people together to share in experiences, through a creative world building platform, has gotten me excited beyond words.

It was a pleasure to join in the conversation about community, human connection, prioritization of features, and maintaining a feeling of simplicity for Topia. It'd be great to connect further to discuss what y'all are looking for on the engineering team, if my skills align with those goals, and if we'd be a good fit working together.

I've put together a summarized list of my recent work to highlight where I may be able to add value to Topia as a company and rapidly expanding codebase.

I look forward to connecting soon.

Cheers
