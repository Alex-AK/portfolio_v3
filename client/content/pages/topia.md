# **Hello**, Daniel and Chris of Topia!

My name is <a href="/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex King</a>.

Immediately upon joining your campfire in Topia (/hunters), I felt a profound sense of belonging and synchronicity, both of which prompted me to reach out.

Topia's mission to bring people together in shared experience, through a creative world building platform, aligns with my creative goals as well as my values as a software engineer.

After connecting at the campfire, I believe my skills would add value to Topia's vision and upcoming interface development, world building user experience expansions, and permissions work.

I've put together a summarized list of my recent work to highlight where I may be able to add value to Topia as a company and rapidly expanding codebase.

Hope to connect soon.

Cheers

<br/>
