# Alex's Virtual Birthday ðŸ¥³

To connect with friends from all over the country (and in a safe manner), I'll be hosting a virtual 33rd birthday party! You are invited to stop by at any time during the event. I look forward to seeing you.

## Platform
My birthday will be hosted on Topia. A platform that enables group video chat inside an illustrated digital world. You can walk around the world and engage with those nearby.
