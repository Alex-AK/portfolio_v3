## Personal & Creative

The last couple of months have been a process of creative exploration, knitting, and cooking.

- **Cooking** - making pickled vegetables and preserves, planning holiday feasts for upcoming virtual holiday dinners.
- **Knitting** - started small with some knit squares for practice. Almost done with my first big project - a circular scarf with alternating knit patterns.
