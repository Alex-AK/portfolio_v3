## Personal & Creative

Since reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Artists-Way-25th-Anniversary/dp/0143129252" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Artist's Way</a> I have been prioritizing creative exploration. Here are a few things I've been up to in my free time.

- **Cooking** - planning holiday meals, cooking feasts, and enjoying virtual holiday dinners with family.
- **Bread Making** - working on some of my first gluten free home made bread recipes. I'm starting with <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/blitz-bread-no-fuss-focaccia-recipe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">King Arthur's No-Fuss Focaccia</a>. My first loaf turned out well, with some room for improvement!
- **Knitting / Crocheting** - I recently finished my <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/simple-yet-effective" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">circular scarf with alternating knit patterns</a> after a few sample squares. Now I'm trying out a few crochet squares to see how it compares to knitting.
