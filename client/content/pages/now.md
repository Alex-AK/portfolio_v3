## Personal & Creative

The last couple of months have been a process of creative exploration, buying plants for my apartment, and walking a lot.

- **Guitar** - it's been years since I've played guitar. I sold my last instrument 5 years ago after moving around several times and losing an interest in playing. I recently bought myself a <a href="https://www.acclaim-music.com/live/images/T/Norman%20039807%20Acclaim%20thumb.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Norman Expedition Parlor Acoustic</a> and have been playing daily.

- **Cooking** - working on making house made pasta and ravioli.

- **Backpacking and Camping** - getting back into camping (haven't done much since childhood) and planning my first bike camping trips.
