# **An Evening** Home.

**This event is currently postponed until it is safe to gather in person.**

<br/>

The idea for An Evening Home came when a friend shared a story of homemade calzone night - where friends, neighbors, and acquaintances would come together monthly and share an evening together.

## The Plan.

An Evening Home will be hosted one weekend evening a month at my apartment. There will be food, drinks, boardgames, mario cart tournaments, cooking nights, movie nights, and conversation. Upon request, I will send you event information with directions the week of.
