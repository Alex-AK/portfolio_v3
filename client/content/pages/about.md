## Services

As a software engineer, my goal is to help you achieve yours - I'm here to plan, build, and deliver quality software with an emphasis on achieving business goals and serving your customers. I specialize in building simple, ethical, accessible, and performant web applications.

<!-- ### **Previous Work** -->

<!-- - Lead software engineer at <a href="https://brainsquall.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BrainSquall</a>. -->

<!-- - Quality assurance and technical consultant with <a href="https://matrixmultiplier.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matrix Multiplier</a> and <a href="https://forumone.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forum One</a>. -->

## Values

I'm interest in working on building ethical and altruistic products. Here are some values that align with my work.

- Mission driven organizations and products
- Strong communication and transparency
- Privacy focused and ethical data practices
- Simple over complex
  <!-- - User first design and user experience -->
  <!-- - Explicit over implicit -->
  <!-- - Web accessibility matters -->
  <!-- - Emphasize organization and documentation -->

<!-- [Interesting in working with me?](/contact) I offer free initial consultations so we can assess if working together is a good fit.  -->

## Personal

I'm introverted at heart <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(INFJ)</a> and enjoy connecting with others. As an ex biologist / yoga instructor turned software engineer, I think it's clear that dachshunds are by far the best dogs.
