Currently working as the lead software developer with <a href="https://brainsquall.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BrainSquall</a> and doing quality assurance and technical consultant with <a href="https://matrixmultiplier.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matrix Multiplier</a> and <a href="https://forumone.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forum One</a>.

As a freelance software developer, my goal is to support you in building quality software and websites with an emphasis on pleasant user experience. I specialize in building simple, accessible, and performant web applications.

If you're looking to plan or prototype a new project, working on wireframes or designs, building an minimum viable product (MVP), or expanding an existing product, let's chat!

## Personal life

My name is Alex - I'm introverted at heart <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(INFJ)</a> and enjoy connecting with others. As an ex biologist / yoga instructor turned software developer, I think it's clear that dachshunds are by far the best dogs. Need I say more?

<!-- A theme that runs through my actions is simplicity.

Continued learning and balance. I write, share, and mentor others so I can continue to learn and grow. -->
