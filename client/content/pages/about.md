## Personal

I'm introverted at heart <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(INFJ)</a> and enjoy connecting with others. As an ex biologst / yoga instructor turned software developer, I think it's clear that dachshunds are by far the best dogs.
