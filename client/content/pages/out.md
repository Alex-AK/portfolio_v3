# Happy summer everyone! ⛱

An Evening Out is a collection of outdoor Seattle based events to help connect friends, neighbors, and acquaintances.

## **The Event**

My friend Jeff and I are hosting a **small outdoor gathering at Myrtle Edwards Park on July 4th from 2-6pm**. This gathering will be relatively small and simple. We'll provide hotdogs and buns (regular and gluten free options) with condiments and chips. We'll have a couple of blankets, hammocks, and a frisbee.

The event is intended to be casual — join for the full event or come and go as you please. And feel free to bring friends/family or forward this invite (open to all who are kind and respectful).

## **The Details**

**Time** — 2 - 6 pm

**Address** — [Myrtle Edwards Park](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Myrtle+Edwards+Park/@47.619438,-122.3640057,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x5490155c45d028e3:0xbd4badc7fd400a1a!8m2!3d47.619438!4d-122.361817) - this will take you to the approximate location we'll setup - based available space.

**Parking** — [450 3rd Ave W](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Washington+State+Department+of+Licensing+-+Seattle+Driver+Licensing+Office/@47.6219406,-122.3605187,17.76z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x54906ab10bad4cf1:0xf33224dc0891622d!8m2!3d47.6222683!4d-122.3604674) - this will take you to the Washington Department of Licensing Office (sorry). There is plenty of street parking available in this area and gives you easy access to the walking bridge ([W Thomas Street Overpass](https://www.google.com/maps/place/W+Thomas+Street+Overpass,+Seattle,+WA+98119/@47.6210044,-122.3629338,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x5490155b59b7e409:0x538cb8f8fe7c21a0!8m2!3d47.6210044!4d-122.3607451)) which leads right to the park.

**Bring Your Own** — this event will be relatively low key, feel free to bring anything that would make you more comfortable like drinks, chairs/blankets to sit on, sunscreen, etc. Please bring plenty of water!

## **Additional Information**

**Sun and shade** — ideally we'll be setup in a spot with sun and shade, but this will largely depend on the available space at the park. Please be prepared with proper sun protection if we're unable to get a shaded option.

**Bathrooms** — bathrooms are a bit of a walk from this park, it's about a 15 minute walk each way from where we will be located ([directions here](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Restroom,+Elliott+Bay+Park,+Elliott+Bay+Trail,+Seattle,+WA+98119/Myrtle+Edwards+Park,+3130+Alaskan+Way,+Seattle,+WA+98121/@47.6229711,-122.3725156,16z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x54901520d8af8e4b:0xfeee74d4bf52e4fb!2m2!1d-122.3744499!2d47.6265292!1m5!1m1!1s0x5490155c45d028e3:0xbd4badc7fd400a1a!2m2!1d-122.361817!2d47.619438!3e2)). Please keep this in mind when planning.

**Comfort** — since this event is relatively small and simple, we'll be providing some food but no drinks. Feel free to bring whatever you'd like including other food, drinks, games, seating, water, etc.

**Masks** — this will be hosted outside, I'll leave this to your comfort level.
